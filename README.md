# My Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio for Binaya Luitel.


## Description:
As a part of this assignment, I attempted to create a responsive portfolio which graciously expands/contracts when browser width is changed between different devices such as desktop, table, mobile, etc. We also learned bootstrap and grid system which is integral part of web development.
